# Receipt_Image_Classification-
Classifying the image either as Receipt or not, based on the considered Image patterns and the Extracted text associated with the considered Image.

Algorithm of using 3 models for Classifying the Image either Receipt or not a Receipt,

            Models considered in Classifying :

              1)      Pattern Recognition Model,

              2)      Text Feature Extraction Model,

              3)      Receipt Classifier

The Algorithm is considering both Image patterns similar to Receipt image paterns and Text information in the Image of considered Image.

Image Patterns Extraction (Pattern Recognition Model).
  Convolution Network of 8 layers with 2*4 layers residual feedbacks used in remembering the Patterns of the Receipt Images.
